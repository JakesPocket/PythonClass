	Bill Clinton's statement about the jobs produced during either party's years holding the White House
    was mostly accurate. Pulling the data from the government’s website and doing my own calculations show
    his  numbers regarding the years were spot on. Although his numbers of new jobs produced over those
    years were a bit off, jobs produced in years of the Democrats were still nearly doubled when compared to
    the Republicans. So, if the records of the government can be trusted, then Bill Clinton has some strong
    data supporting his statement! The facts check out close enough for me. When dealing in the tens of millions,
    a few million doesn't make much a difference.
                
    Bill Clintons’ Statement:
        “Since 1961, for 52 years now, the Republicans have held the White House 28 years, the Democrats 24.
        In those 52 years, our private economy has produced 66 million private-sector jobs. So what’s the
        jobs score? Republicans 24 million, Democrats 42 (million).”

    My calculations based on government records:
		   Republican Years: 28
		   Democratic Years: 24
		        Total Years: 52
		New Republican Jobs: 21,876,000
		New Democratic Jobs: 40,464,000
		     Total New Jobs: 62,340,000
